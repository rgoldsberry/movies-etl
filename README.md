# movies-etl
Data Analysis Bootcamp - Week 8
The purpose of this repo is to collect my work done in learning ETL with Python and postgres. 

## Lesson Work

In the lesson we worked through a Jupyter notebook and figurd out how to load, clean, and send three different files to Postgres. The lesson work can be found in [data_exploring.ipynb](data_exploring.ipynb)

## Challenge Work

For the challenge we were tasked with taking all the work we did in the module and creating one single function that will do all the work at once, so the data can be updated as often as we want. The final function can be found in [ETL_create_database.ipynb](ETL_create_database.ipynb)
